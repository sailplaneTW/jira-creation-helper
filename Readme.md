Jira is a great tool to manage issues, but there are many fields should be filled when creating issue. Write a greasemonkey/tampermonkey script to fill several fields automatically.
	- fill product name according to project name
	- reduce the product name dropdown list only possible options left
	- the due day is 7 days after today by default
	- assign to creator by default
	- SQA verification is no by default
